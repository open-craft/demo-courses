<p>In addition to regular steps, Step Builder can also contain a <strong>Review Step</strong> component which:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>allows students to review their performance</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>allows students to jump back to individual steps to review their answers (if the <strong>Extended feedback</strong> setting is enabled and the maximum number of attempts has been reached)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>supports "conditional messages" that will be shown during the review step based on certain conditions such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>the student achieved a perfect score</li>
<li>the student did not achieve a perfect score</li>
<li>the student is allowed to try again, or has used up all attempts</li>
</ul>
</li>
