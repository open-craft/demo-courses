<p>Welcome to the Problem Builder Demo course. This course introduces two XBlocks: Problem Builder and Step Builder.</p>
<p>Both blocks allow authors to create questions of various types. They can be used to simulate the workflow of real-life mentoring, within an edX course.</p>
<p>Supported features include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Free-form answers</strong> (textarea) which can be shared across different XBlock instances (for example, to allow a student to review and edit an answer they gave before).</li>
<li><strong>Self-assessment MCQs</strong> (multiple choice questions), to display predetermined feedback to a student based on his choices in the self-assessment. Supports rating scales and arbitrary answers.</li>
<li><strong>MRQs (Multiple Response Questions)</strong>, a type of multiple choice question that allows the student to select more than one choice.</li>
<li><strong>Answer recaps</strong> that display a read-only summary of a user's answer to a free-form question asked earlier in the course.</li>
<li><strong>Progression tracking</strong>, to require that the student has completed a particular step before allowing them to complete the next step. Provides a link to the next step to the student.</li>
<li><strong>Tables</strong>, which allow to present answers from the student to free-form answers in a concise way. Supports custom headers.</li>
<li><strong>Dashboards</strong>, for displaying a summary of the student's answers to multiple choice questions.</li>
</ul>
