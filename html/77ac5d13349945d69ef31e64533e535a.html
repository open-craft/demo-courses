<p>You can enable the Problem Builder and Step Builder XBlocks in Studio by modifying the advanced settings for your course:</p>
<ol>
<li>From the main page of a specific course, navigate to <strong>Settings</strong> ‚ü∂ <strong>Advanced Settings</strong> from the top menu.</li>
<li>Find the <strong>Advanced Module List</strong> setting.</li>
<li>To enable <em>Problem Builder</em> for your course, add <code>"problem-builder"</code> to the modules listed there.</li>
<li>To enable <em>Step Builder</em> for your course, add <code>"step-builder"</code> to the modules listed there.</li>
<li>Click the <strong>Save changes</strong> button.</li>
</ol>
<p>Note that it is perfectly fine to enable both Problem Builder and Step Builder for your course -- the blocks do not interfere with each other.</p>
