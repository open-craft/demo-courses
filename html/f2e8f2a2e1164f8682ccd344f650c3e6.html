<p><strong>Step Builder</strong> lets authors build more complex exercises where questions are grouped into "steps" and students answer the questions in each step at a time. An optional "review step" can be added to the end of the exercise, which can summarize the student's results and provide tailored feedback and study suggestions.</p>
