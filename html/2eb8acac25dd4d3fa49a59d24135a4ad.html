<p>After adding a Step Builder block to a course you can click on the <strong>VIEW</strong> button (located at the top right of the block) to open the block for editing.</p>
<p>Step Builder is similar to Problem Builder, but it allows you to group questions into explicit steps, and to provide more detailed feedback to students.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Instead of adding questions to Step Builder itself, you'll need to add one or more <strong>Mentoring Step</strong> blocks to Step Builder. You can then add one or more questions to each step by clicking the <strong>VIEW</strong> button displayed in the top right corner of the block.</p>
<p>This allows you to group questions into logical units (without being limited to showing only a single question per step). As students progress through the block, Step Builder will display one step at a time. All questions belonging to a step need to be completed before the step can be submitted.</p>
<p>See Section "Supported Question and Content Types" for more information about the types of questions you can add to Step Builder.</p>
